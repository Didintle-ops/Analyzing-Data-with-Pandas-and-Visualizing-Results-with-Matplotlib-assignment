📊 Analyzing Data with Pandas & Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
📝 Description

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python. The objective is to load a dataset, perform basic analysis, and create visual insights using the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

🎯 Objective

Load and explore a dataset using pandas.

Compute basic statistics and identify patterns.

Visualize data using matplotlib (and seaborn for styling).

Gain insights and present findings clearly.

📂 Submission Requirements

Submit either a:

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Python script (.py)

The submission must include:

✅ Data loading & exploration steps

✅ Basic data analysis results

✅ Visualizations (at least four types)

✅ Findings and observations

🔹 Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Choose a CSV dataset (examples: Iris dataset, sales dataset, etc.).

Load the dataset using pandas.

Inspect the data using .head().

Explore data structure with .info() and check for missing values.

Clean the dataset by filling or dropping missing values.

💡 Tip: Handle errors using try / except to avoid crashes when loading files.

🔹 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Compute basic statistics: mean, median, standard deviation using .describe().

Perform grouping on a categorical column (e.g., species, region) and compute numerical averages per group.

Identify interesting patterns or observations.

📌 Example insights:

Certain categories may have consistently higher numerical values.

Relationships between columns may reveal trends or differences.

🔹 Task 3: Data Visualization

Create at least four different plots:

Line Chart 📈 – show trends over time or sequence (e.g., sepal length per sample).

Bar Chart 📊 – compare numerical values across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).

Histogram 📑 – display distribution of numerical values (e.g., sepal width).

Scatter Plot 🔹 – show relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal vs. petal length).

Customization tips:

Add titles, axis labels, and legends.

Use seaborn styles for more visually appealing charts.

🧰 Additional Instructions

Use public datasets (Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository).

Handle missing values and errors gracefully.

Include comments and explanations in your code.

Ensure all plots are clearly labeled and provide insights.

📊 Example Dataset

For this project, the Iris dataset was used:

Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

Target: species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

This allows demonstrating data analysis and visualization for a classification dataset.

🎨 Visualizations in this Project

Line chart of sepal length trends by species

Bar chart of average petal length per species

Histogram of sepal width distribution

Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length, colored by species

📌 Observations / Findings

Setosa has smaller petal length/width compared to other species.

Virginica tends to have the largest sepal and petal dimensions.

Patterns in the scatter plot show clear separation between species.
